# What is OpenCV
OpenCV is the huge python open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today’s systems.

By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human. When it integrated with various libraries, such as NumPy, python is capable of processing the OpenCV array structure for analysis.

Using OpenCV library, you can 

    *Read and write images
    
    *Capture and save videos
    
    *Process images (filter, transform)
    
    *Perform feature detection
    
    *Detect specific objects such as faces, eyes, cars, in the videos or images.
    
    *Analyze the video, i.e., estimate the motion in it, subtract the background, and track objects in it.
    
# How to install openCV in your system
Install the openCV packages by using the following command in command prompt or any other environment

*pip install opencv-python*

To install all the packages contributed with opencv, we use following command

*pip install opencv-contrib-python*
